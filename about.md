I was born in Portugal but I'm currently living in San Francisco. I co-founded with some good friends a YCombinator backed company called [Orankl](http://www.orankl.com) that is focused on developing software for online stores.

I'm a Physicist by training and I have done research in particle physics for the AMS-2 collaboration, studying the [effect of the Sun in the flux of cosmic rays that reaches the AMS-2 detector](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/downloadFile/395144667265/dissertacao.pdf) in the International Space Station.

I'm also one of the founders of [Fermat's Library](http://www.fermatslibrary.com), a platform to annotate and illuminate academic papers. You can find me there commenting papers mostly about Physics and Math. My favorite paper in the platform is [Feynman's derivation of the Schr√∂dinger equation](http://fermatslibrary.com/s/feynmans-derivation-of-the-schrodinger-equation).

Feel free to reach out if you want to get in touch with me: luis@orankl.com.
